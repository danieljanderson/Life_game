# for the Person class
I know that I don't check data types in my classes so you could make a number into a name.  I will need to change that.

I have to add logic to search the employment history to see if the person has worked at the job before and then move that to the front of the list.  And to make sure that their isnt duplicates

I have to add logic to so if someone gets a job they really want the mood goes up more than if they get a job that they didnt really want.

I have to add logic so if someone losses a job they really enjoyed the mood goes down more than if they lose a job they didn't really want.

Have to add two types of accounts savings and checking and logic to see if they are bankruptcy

# for the relationship class 
come up with something that checks the hobbies between person 1 and person 2 and then suggest doing said event.  If you end up doing it the connection increases more than if you chose to do something else.

keep track of how many times a activity has been done.

I need to add a way to keep track of the length of time someone started to date and when it ended.
