I might need to work on the scaling of skills.  it might be too easy to get jobs.  like for example 
if (randomnumber is > 3)
skill + 1
if(randomnumber is > 8)
skill + 2
if (random number is =10)
skill  + 3

the above example might also work for taking away skills

## Notes on the Person Class
Add a way the person can gain charisma
move apply to the Event Class

## Notes on event class
there are a number of ways to get a job
you either apply (and then get a job screening)
or you apply and go directly to the phone interview

BELOW ARE THE DIFFERENT POSSIBLITIES OF OUT COMES.  THE OUT COMES ARE GOING TO BE DECIDED ON THE MAIN PROGRAM
If you pass the job screening 
you gain feeling + the number of job apps you have done

if you fail the job screening
you lose the feeling - the number of job apps you have done

if you apply and  get rejected 
you lose the feeling - the number of job apps

if you apply and get accepted (networking is an option to increase chance of success.  CHOICE WILL BE DECIDED ON THE MAIN PROGRAM)
you gain the feeling + the number of job apps you get

phone interview 
if you fail you lose feeling - randomNumber (between 1-9)

if you pass you will gain feeling + randomNumber (between 1-9)

in person interview.  Computer will get two random numbers and add them together if the out come is greater than the person than they will lose feeling / divded by the number of interviews they have been on.

if they successd they will gain feeling * by the number of interviews they have been on.



##inPerson Interview might need to be scaled some how. for when the person gets better charisma and such than it will be two easy to get a job.  maybe make the person into levels

in person interview.  when someone fails or pass their first interview feelings is feelings should get modified.  right now it isnt

# when you buy a car you should be able to take out a lone and than pay that back by a percentage per month.

# notes on the main program
When Event.trySomethingNew is implemented the question "did you enjoy it it"  gets asked and if the answer is yes is added to the person.hobbies array
